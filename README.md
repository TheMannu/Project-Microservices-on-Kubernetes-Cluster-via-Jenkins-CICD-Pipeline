# Deploying 10 Microservices on Kubernetes Cluster via Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

## Project Overview
In this project, we will deploy 10 microservices on a Kubernetes cluster using a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. The process involves setting up a base server, installing necessary tools, configuring a Kubernetes cluster (EKS) on AWS, and creating a Jenkins pipeline to fetch code from GitHub and deploy it on the EKS cluster.
